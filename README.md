## I'm a Musician, Audio Engineer, Developer, Teacher, and Cat Dad

- ðŸŒ± I focus on develping audio plugins, so DSP coupled with software development.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m working as a general software engineer @ Audiofile-Engineering: plugin development, Electron desktop development, and Jest testing.
- ðŸ¥… My goals are to make really cool audio technology for musicians everywhere.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I also dabble in graphic design, electronics, am an avid gamer, and have three cats that I love dearly.
