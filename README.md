# Landon Viator, PhD

I'm a passionate musician and engineer with a deep love for creating innovative audio software. My journey in music 
and technology has led me to specialize in developing cutting-edge audio applications that enhance sound experiences 
for users. I primarily work with C++ and the JUCE framework, leveraging my expertise to craft efficient and 
high-performance audio plugins..

What I Do

- Audio Software Development: I design and build audio plugins that cater to musicians, producers, and audio engineers, 
ensuring they meet the highest standards of sound quality and usability.

- DSP Expertise: With a strong background in Digital Signal Processing (DSP), I focus on developing algorithms that mimic 
analog warmth and precision, bringing unique sound qualities to digital platforms.

- Creative Collaboration: I enjoy collaborating with other musicians and developers, always eager to explore new ideas 
and push the boundaries of what's possible in audio technology.

Technologies I Use

- Programming Languages: C++, C#, Rust, Python
- Frameworks: Juce, VST, AU, AAX, Unity
- Systems: Mac, Linux, Windows
- Tools: CLion, CMake, Xcode, Visual Studio
- DevOps: Git, GitHub Actions (CI/CD), Unit Testing

Projects & Contributions

- Open-Source Projects: I contribute to open-source audio projects and am always looking for ways to give back to the 
community.

- YouTube Channel: I create educational content about C++ and audio programming, helping others learn and grow in the 
field.
